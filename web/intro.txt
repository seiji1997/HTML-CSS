I studied synthetic organic chemistry until graduate school, where I was involved in the development of novel reactions using transition metal catalysts. In the latter half of graduate school, I taught myself Python and Machine Learning from scratch to predict reaction yields. Joined RAKUS Partners Co., Ltd. as a new graduate as a machine learning engineer. At the first assignment, a startup GCP vendor, I was engaged in DWH construction, data pipeline construction, data scientist training program, and recommendation system improvement. For the second assignment, I worked on a wide range of tasks from upstream to downstream, including the development, operation, and technical support of the main business, household account book data BI. In development and operation, I was in charge of a wide range of tasks necessary to operate BI tools, such as infrastructure design/modification, DWH construction, acceptance evaluation, improvement of business efficiency by preparing environment construction manuals, creation of programs for data monitoring, and examination of query acceleration. In technical support work, I always communicate closely with members of development, operation, sales, and marketing and respond to client inquiries and requests for data extraction.
